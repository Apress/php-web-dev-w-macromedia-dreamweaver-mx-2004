The files for this chapter are arranged in the same folder structure as used by the case study in Chapter 9.

Index.php is the basic file from which the template (Templates/basic.dwt.php) is created.
Index2.php is a child page of the template before editable attributes were added.
Index3.php is the same page after the addition of editable attributes.
Index4.php demonstrates the inclusion of the menu as an HTML file (menu.html).
Index5.php demonstates the inclusion of the menu as a PHP function (menu.php).

The other files should be self-explanatory from the context of the chapter.
